## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- Auto-Updating Location on the Map was cancelled due to time constraints
- Notifications sent to meetup organizers for newly joined users were removed due to time constraints
- Multi Campus support (downtown BCIT) was scrapped due to time contraints

### Future Work

- Allow Clustr to automatically update the users location without having to click on the map
- Recieve notifications and reminders for upcoming meetups and recent attendees
- Implement more campuses (notably downtown BCIT campus) to support more students
